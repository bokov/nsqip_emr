abstract: |
  Exploration of event dates in Sunrise EMR vs NSQIP Registry data. Here we
  present histograms of event frequencies ([**fig. 1**](#fig:eventdist00),
  [**fig. 2**](#fig:eventdist01) ) and timelines
  ([**fig. 3**](#fig:allevents00), [**fig. 4**](#fig:allevents01)) to aid in
  understanding patterns of discrepancies in admission/discharge dates
  between the two data sources. [**fig. 5**](#fig:allevents02) and
  [**fig. 6**](#fig:allevents03) are versions of the previous two figures
  with events excluded if precede the last pre-NSQIP inpatient discharge or
  follow the first post-NSQIP inpatient admission (if any). The trends
  observed so far are summarized in the
  [**Full Timelines**](#full-timelines) section in the latter half of this
  report.

  This report is directly generated by a
  script that can be obtained from https://github.com/bokov/nsqip_emr.
  The data needs to be obtained separately from the authors though there is
  a simulated dataset that comes with the git repository. Questions or
  problems can be submitted [via this link](https://github.com/bokov/nsqip_emr/issues/new).
